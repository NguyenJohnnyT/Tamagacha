> **TAMAGACHA** 
> - Collect all five Tamas -- they each have different stories!
> - Feed, play, and take them out
> - See what they're saying when theyâ€™re hungry, sad, or happy
> - Make sure to keep up and check on them to see their happiness level..
> - because if they're not happy, they can.... **die** :(
